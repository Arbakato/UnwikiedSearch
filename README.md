# Unwikied Search
A Brave goggle made for researching topics without using Wikipedia. A constant work-in-progress. 

## How do I use it then?

You can try this goggle by [clicking here](https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FArbakato%2FUnwikiedSearch%2Fmain%2FUnwikiedSearch), or add it to your list of goggles [here](https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FArbakato%2FUnwikiedSearch%2Fmain%2FUnwikiedSearch&nav=site)

## I think you should add X site.

Open an issue and I might consider it. This is a work in progress!

## Inclusion guidelines

Of course, I need to set a standard or limit for which sites I add or don't, and which sites get a higher or lower ranking. As for now, I haven't had the time to sit and throughly create guidelines. But there's a few things I already know:

* The main focus of this goggle is adding sites focused on delivering factual information about a given subject, or that host a research article.
* The site has to offer free access to the content the user requires.
  * It probably can't be enforced in academic journals, but I think these will be ranked lower in the future.
  * Some sources could be behind a paywall (like say, news sites), in that case I allow them as long as they can be somehow skipped.
* It has to be a reputable source
  * Biases are impossible to account for. Reputation is a bit easier, maybe? For now it doesn't seem to be a problem, might rethink this bit later.
* Content should be primarily in English. It's mainly because I prefer to focus on these first. Spanish might come at a later point. Other languages aren't planned because I won't be able to check them
